  <h2> About us</h2>
  <p> Welcome to BBQ Ta Bai, where the rich flavors of Filipino barbecue come to life in the heart of Cebu. Our journey began with a deep love for Pinoy BBQ—a taste that evokes memories of lively street corners, smoky grills, and the irresistible aroma of marinated meats cooking to perfection.

Inspired by the vibrant street food culture of the Philippines, we set out to recreate the authentic experience of enjoying grilled delights with family and friends. From the tender, smoky pork skewers to the savory chicken inasal, each dish is crafted with passion and a commitment to quality.
At BBQ Ta Bai, we believe that food is more than just sustenance—it's a celebration of culture, tradition, and community. Our menu features classic Filipino barbecue favorites, each prepared with a blend of traditional spices and cooking techniques that have been passed down through generations.
Whether you're a longtime fan of Filipino barbecue or trying it for the first time, we invite you to experience the warmth of our hospitality and the deliciousness of our dishes. Join us and savor the authentic taste of the Philippines, right here in Cebu.</p>
